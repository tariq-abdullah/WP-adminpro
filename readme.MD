# Admin Pro - A cleaner WordPress for simple humans

I have noticed that a lot of people get overwhelmed by the WordPress dashboard on a full-fledged website when used as CMS. The reason being each plugin fighting for notice space, sidebar space and space in whole dashboard in general.

This plugin will make your average user's life simpler with CSS and JS customizations. 

## Customizations

  - Remove all but necessary menu items from sidebar to top bar and make them icon
  - Make login screen beautiful
  - remove borders and other customizations to buttons, lists and dashboard screens
  - Adds an indicator bar to indicate when WordPress is talking to the backend
